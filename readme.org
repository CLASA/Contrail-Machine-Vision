#+TITLE: Contrail Machine Vision
* NASA Space Apps challenge 2016
The [[https://2016.spaceappschallenge.org/challenges/aero/clouds-or-contrails/][Clouds or Contrails]] challenge asks competitors to present a
solution for identifying contrails left by planes. This part of
CLASA's solution entails a machine vision classifier that
discriminates between photos of contrails vs. other clouds.

* How it works
** Data pre-processing
Images arrive from many different devices, each with different
resolutions and colour profiles. First, images are pre-processed to
attempt to make images from different sources as similar as
possible. The following image shows the pre-processing pipeline.

** Features
Next, certain image features are quantified. Images will be recognised
and classified using these features. All chosen features are based off
the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hough_transform][Hough Transform]], which was chosen for its ability to recognise
lines: a critical differing feature of contrails. The exact features
are:
- Standard deviation of the Hough space.
- Kurtosis of the Hough space -- to identify where lines are dominant.
- Z-score of the maximum in Hough space -- again searching for
  dominance of a single line.
- Standard deviation of angles of recognised lines -- are lines
  parallel?
- Number of identified lines

** Learning
The learning algorithm itself is the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_forest][Random Forest]] classifier. This is
a method of machine learning, meaning that the computer must decide
for itself which of the provided features are important in determining
whether an image is of a contrail or not.

** Training and verification
The models are trained on test data collected by entering the terms
"contrail" and "cirrus" into Google Images. 10-fold cross-validation
determined the model estimated with approximately 75% accuracy.

** Improvements
The implementation is a proof of concept only, and could be made far
more accurate. Firstly, more features should be taken from the
data. These could include a host of other features, for example:
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connected_component_(graph_theory)][connected componets]], and using graph analysis, blob analysis, and
possibly texture analysis (not on theshholded images). Other learning
models may also be investigated. Finally, a large dataset could be
used for training, which will be collected through CLASA's web
dashboard.

* Folders
- [[./ml-model][=ml-model=]] contains the python machine training and verification
  code.
- [[./flask-server][=./flask-server=]] contains a web RESTFUL API, currently only
  returning features rather than classification results.
